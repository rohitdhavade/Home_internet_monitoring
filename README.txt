The project is developed in Python to monitor home internet connectivity and generate
a report in excel file with graphs for uptime and latency.

More features to be added soon.

This project as of 03Oct2020 consists of below components-
1. AVG_MAIN.py :
This is the Publisher module as per the Publisher-Subscriber Observer Design Pattern.
The responsibility of this module is to provide required data (average uptime, timestamps, latency) to subscribers.

2. REST_GET_TEST.py and PING_TEST.py
Both these modules perform the function of testing the internet reachability
either through RESP RPC call or through PING, and then provide this data to the 
Publiser component AVG_MAIN.py for further processing. The AVG_MAIN.py module applies the logic to calculate the
Average uptime, latency for given interval.

3. Subscriber_Graph_Output.py and Subcriber_Excel.py
These modules play the role of "Subscribers" as defined in the Observer Design Pattern.
They subscribe to the Publisher module to get data from the Publisher whenever new data is available.
The primary function of these moudles is to get data (average uptime, timestamps, latency) from Publiser and create
graphs, Excel Report using openpyxl or matplotlib.

4. SubscriberInterface.py
This module implements Abstract based Class for Subscribers to be able to implement
the method defined herein, and then the Subscriber should be able to get updated
data from Publiser component by subscribing to it using the Publiser.attach() method.

5. MainCode.py
This is the main module that imports all the others, and initiates the code execution.

6. Report.xlsx
This is the report file automatically generated by the code.
While viewing the report, generate a copy before viewing.

7. INPUTS.txt
This is the input file that provides various switches for user to be able to 
control the websites to which the REST RPC test call may be made, the interval for
which the uptime graph would be generated and whether reporting should be ON or not.
